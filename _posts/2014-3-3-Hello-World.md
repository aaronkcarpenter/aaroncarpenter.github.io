## About Me

### Professional

I'm solution driven at heart. Having developed a solid business acumen over the last 6 years intertwined with a technical skillset allows me to approach problems from a distinct perspective.

In today's economy, this is an enormous asset and has brought what I'd like to consider a thriving and fruitul career, with unlimited potential. I can build software utilizing relevant languages and frameworks while also understanding to focus on the bottom line of business, providing solutions and making money on those solved problems.

With that being said ambition has led me many places in my career. Before making the decision to learn to build software in 2020, I worked in the Supply Chain industry for 6 years, serving many roles with one company, most notably and recently, awarded the opportunity to lead my own teams to personal and professional achievment. While I cherish the relationships that were bonded and those that impacted my career, I knew for a few years that I wanted to provide value and solve problems in another way.

App Academy rigorous has given me the skills that the market is looking for.

### Personal 
In my spare time, I could more than likely be found somewhere on Twitter, my head in a book, or going down Youtube rabbit holes. I enjoy tropical areas and enjoy falling asleep on nice beaches, even if the beach is man made through the resorts I visit. If I had the ability, I'd bring San Diego to Texas.

I'm a foodie, but with age comes wisdom, and a few years ago my wisdom started telling me to not eat bad foods consistently. Burgers, fries, pizza, pasta, burritos, you name it! I'm also quite intrigued by entrepreneurship and the sheer fact that with certain skillsets, you can build something from scratch and sell it if it actually fulfills a real need.
